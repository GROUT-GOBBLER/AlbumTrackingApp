I want to create a simple Java app that will allow me to enter and track the music I listen to / like.

It will feature a clean GUI with buttons and text boxes.

User-entered input will be stored in a .json file.

Will allow you to enter data about each album, review the album, and other things.

Shouldn't be too complex.
